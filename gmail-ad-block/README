Description
====

This is a small script to hide the ad class in the new version of Gmail and Gmail for Google Apps.

I liked the ad placement of the old version of gmail. The new one looks like an email and is distracting.

Works in any version of Chrome or Firefox that supports Greasemonkey.

Installation instructions
====

1. Download the user.js file.
2. Drag it into chrome or firefox
3. Browse gmail, ad free!
